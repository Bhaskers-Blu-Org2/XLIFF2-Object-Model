# XLIFF2-Object-Model
If youâ€™re looking to store localization data and propagate it through your localization pipeline allowing tools to interoperate then you may want to use the XLIFF 2.0 object model.  The XLIFF 2.0 object model implements the OASIS Standard for the XLIFF 2.0 specification as defined at http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.0/xliff-core-v2.0.html.
